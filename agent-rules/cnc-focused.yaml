# COORDINATE SYSTEM
# =============================================================================
coordinate_system:
  description: "Right-hand coordinate system (machining convention)"
  x:
    direction: "length / left-right on table"
    positive: "right"
  y:
    direction: "depth / front-back on table"
    positive: "toward operator"
  z:
    direction: "height / spindle axis"
    positive: "up (away from table)"
  origin: "center of top face (machining datum surface)"

# =============================================================================
# SPATIAL REASONING RULES
# =============================================================================
spatial_rules:
  before_any_operation:
    - "Mentally visualize the current state of the model"
    - "Identify which faces/edges the operation targets"
    - "Verify operation will intersect existing geometry"
    - "Consider tool access - can the end mill reach this feature?"

  boolean_cut:
    - "The cutting tool MUST overlap the target body"
    - "Position cutting tool so it extends BEYOND the target surface"
    - "Use .cut() or .cutBlind() with sufficient depth"
    - "Verify the cut is accessible from the spindle direction"

  boolean_fuse:
    - "Bodies MUST touch or overlap to fuse"
    - "Verify no air gap between bodies"

  extrude:
    - "Positive height = extrude in +Z direction"
    - "Negative height = extrude in -Z direction"
    - "Always specify direction explicitly if not along Z"

  sketch_placement:
    - "XY plane = top face (tool approaches from +Z)"
    - "XZ plane = front face (Y=0)"
    - "YZ plane = side face (X=0)"
    - "Use .faces('>Z') to select top face for next operation"
    - "Use .faces('<Z') to select bottom face"

# =============================================================================
# CADQUERY CODE REQUIREMENTS
# =============================================================================
code_requirements:
  mandatory:
    - "Always import cadquery as cq"
    - "Final result MUST be assigned to variable named 'result'"
    - "Use CadQuery's fluent API (method chaining)"
    - "All dimensions in millimeters"

  forbidden:
    - "Do NOT use show_object() or display()"
    - "Do NOT use cq.exporters directly - the runner handles export"
    - "Do NOT use matplotlib or any GUI libraries"
    - "Do NOT read/write files"

# CNC MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINTS
# =============================================================================
manufacturing:
  process: "CNC Milling (3-axis)"

  internal_radii:
    minimum: 1.5           # mm - typical smallest end mill radius
    recommended: 3.0       # mm - standard 6mm end mill
    rule: "All internal corners must have a radius >= 1.5mm (tool radius)"
    on_violation: "Add fillet to internal corners matching tool radius"
    note: "Internal corner radius = end mill radius. Specify which tool size."

  tool_access:
    rule: "All features must be accessible from the Z+ direction (3-axis)"
    max_reach_depth: 50    # mm - typical tool length
    undercuts_allowed: false
    rule_detail: "No undercuts, enclosed cavities, or features requiring tool approach from sides"
    on_violation: "Redesign feature to be accessible from top, or suggest multi-setup machining"

  pockets:
    min_corner_radius: 1.5      # mm - end mill radius
    max_depth_to_width_ratio: 3  # depth / pocket width
    min_width: 3.0              # mm - minimum pocket width (tool diameter)
    rule: "Pocket depth should not exceed 3x the pocket width"
    on_violation: "Suggest shallower pocket or wider opening"
    floor_flatness: "Pocket floors should be flat (no complex bottom surfaces)"

  holes:
    min_diameter: 1.0       # mm - smallest practical drill
    standard_sizes:         # prefer standard drill sizes
      - 2.0
      - 2.5
      - 3.0
      - 3.3
      - 4.0
      - 4.2
      - 5.0
      - 6.0
      - 6.8
      - 8.0
      - 10.0
    depth_to_diameter_ratio: 5  # max depth / diameter for drilling
    rule: "Prefer standard drill sizes. Depth should not exceed 5x diameter."

  walls:
    min_thickness: 1.0      # mm - thin walls deflect under cutting forces
    recommended: 2.0        # mm
    min_height_to_thickness_ratio: 8  # tall thin walls vibrate
    rule: "Walls must be >= 1.0mm thick. Height/thickness ratio <= 8."
    on_violation: "Increase wall thickness or reduce height"

  draft_angles:
    vertical_walls: 0       # degrees - CNC can cut vertical walls
    note: "Draft angles not required for CNC (unlike injection molding)"

  surface_finish:
    achievable_ra: 1.6      # micrometers Ra typical
    step_over_scallop: true
    rule: "Surface finish depends on step-over and tool radius"

  tolerances:
    general: 0.05           # mm - typical CNC tolerance
    tight: 0.01             # mm - achievable with care
    hole_position: 0.05     # mm
    rule: "Design with +/-0.05mm general tolerance. Tighter tolerances cost more."

  fixturing:
    flat_bottom_preferred: true
    min_clamping_surface: 100  # mm^2
    rule: "Ensure adequate flat surface for workholding"
    on_violation: "Add clamping tabs or redesign base for fixturing"

# =============================================================================

      on_fail: "Increase wall thickness"

    - check: "cut_intersects"

      on_fail: "Recalculate cut position"

      on_fail: "Report error, suggest fixes"

    - check: "no_self_intersection"
      rule: "No self-intersecting geometry"
      on_fail: "Simplify operations, rebuild step by step"

    - "Check face/edge selectors are valid"
    - "Verify the workplane is correct"
    - "Fix and regenerate the complete code"

# =============================================================================
# CODE GENERATION STYLE
# =============================================================================
code_style:
  naming:
    - "Use descriptive variable names: 'bolt_pocket_depth' not 'd1'"
    - "Use UPPER_CASE for dimension constants"
    - "Use lowercase for intermediate results"

  comments:
    - "Comment the INTENT, not the operation"
    - "Note tool size requirements for internal features"
    - "Indicate machining setup/orientation"

  organization:
    - "Define dimensions as named constants at top"
    - "Group related operations"
    - "Use intermediate variables for complex geometry"
    - "Include tool radius as a named constant"

    # Material: 6061 Aluminum
    # Setup: clamp bottom, machine from top (Z+)
    # Tool: 6mm end mill (R3.0 internal corners)

    TOOL_RADIUS = 3.0       # mm - 6mm end mill
    PLATE_W = 80.0          # mm - plate width
    PLATE_D = 60.0          # mm - plate depth
    PLATE_H = 10.0          # mm - plate thickness
    POCKET_DEPTH = 5.0      # mm - pocket depth (ratio 0.5:1)
    BOLT_HOLE_DIA = 5.5     # mm - clearance for M5

    result = (
